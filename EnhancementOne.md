## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

The artifact that I chose for the Software Engineering/Design enhancement was my Final Project for CS 330 and was created early August 2019. The original purpose of this code was to demonstrate my abilities by using C++ and OpenGL to render an everyday object in three-dimensional space. For my CS 330 Final, I chose to render a cup and apply basic lighting and a metal texture to the cup.

I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to use C++ and my ability to render and object by calculating its vertices and drawing hundreds of triangles. Another reason I chose this artifact is because I found it particularly interesting at the time and had researched how to improve my code not long after itâ€™s initial submission. This turned out to be beneficial because I could use what I learned and apply it for the purposes of this class. My enhancements to this code involve adjusting the lighting, increasing the complexity of the rendered object, and creating and texturing a surrounding environment. Overall, I believe the enhancement of this artifact shows my ability to implement a design solution, solve logic problems, and work towards accomplishing a goal.

While I had studied how to enhance this artifact not too long after its original submission, I had set it to the side for a long while and forgotten most of what I learned. As a result, I had to spend quite a bit of time refamiliarizing myself with the OpenGL pipeline and how I planned to enhance my model. Fortunately, I had my notes on the vertices I originally planned to use, but ultimately scrapped due to the complexity and the possibility of exceeding the original limit of 1000 triangles. In addition to recreating my model and reworking the lighting, I also had to learn how to implement multiple textures. I ended up choosing to merge the multiple textures into one file, but had to go back and rework the texture coordinates for all of my vertices as a result.
