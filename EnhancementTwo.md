## Enhancement Two: Data Structures & Algorithms

The artifact that I chose for the Algorithms and Data Structure enhancement was my Final Project for IT 145 and was created in October 2018. The original purpose of this code was to demonstrate my abilities using Java to create a simple authentication for a zoo. The original code runs from a command line interface, prompts a user for their log-in information, and checks to see if their inputs matches data stored in a text file. My original plan to enhance this code was to rewrite it in Visual Basic, adding GUI elements and using arrays to store data.

I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it allowed me to take a basic framework from an early class and enhance it using the skills I had learned from CS 260 – Data Structures and Algorithms. I think using an artifact that was more basic allowed more flexibility in choosing enhancements for the artifact. As mentioned earlier, my enhancements to the code include adding GUI elements and increasing the overall user experience. Animal data is stored and manipulated using both arrays and ArrayLists and a bubble sort is used to manage the data within the arrays. Additionally, I chose to implement a structure to store animal data and properties.

Visual Basic was the very first programming language I had experience with so I chose to work with it for nostalgia reasons. However, I haven’t used it since high school, so I had to take a while and learn how to use it. I also worked in Visual Studio, a different IDE than what I’m used to. I’m aware that Visual Basic ArrayLists have a built-in sort method, so I built a separate sub procedure to implement the logic for a bubble sort. In addition, understanding the nuances of Visual Basic added slightly more difficulty than I originally expected. Overall, I had fun with this enhancement and was able to implement my desired changes with relative ease.
