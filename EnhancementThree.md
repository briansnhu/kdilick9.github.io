## Enhancement Three: Databases
The artifact that I chose for the Database enhancement was the data from DAT 220 and was used in March 2019. This data represents customers information collected by a specific store and was originally used for data mining. This data was analyzed using JMP to check the collected data for statistical significance to allow the company to more effectively market their products. My plan to enhance this code involved importing the data to a MongoDB database and creating an HTML interface to allow a user to interact with the data within the database.

I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it allows me a chance to build my own product to manipulate data used in a previous class. I also wanted to take my learning from CS 340 one step further. The final project from that class involved using MongoDB and creating a RESTful API to allow a user to manipulate data inside of the database. That final project worked from command line interface and was originally implemented using Python. For the Database enhancement I chose to work with Express, a Node.js web application framework, in order to implement a RESTful API. 

This enhancement involved learning a lot of new things. My only experience with MongoDB and REST APIs was with the final project for CS 340. Since I was using Express, I also had to quickly pick up Javascript, Jade, and CSS, all of which I had never used before. I spent a lot of time researching what I wanted to do with this enhancement versus the other enhancements, which I think was a good thing because I was able to learn quite a bit. However, since most of this is new to me I think my implementation may have a few gaps in it and could have been done better. Despite that I think this was a pretty good first step to creating an interface for a MongoDB database.
